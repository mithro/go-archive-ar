# go-archive-ar
Go library for reading/writing ar files ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ar_(Unix) ) -- ar is generally used only to create and update static library files that the link editor or linker uses and for generating .deb packages for the Debian family; it can be used to create archives for any purpose, but has been largely replaced by tar for purposes other than static libraries.
